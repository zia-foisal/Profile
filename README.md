*I have joined Center for Natural Resources Studies(CNRS) a national non-government organization as a "Senior Forestry Officer" on their WFP funded Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) project in the Rohingya Refugee Camps of Cox's Bazar District in Bangladesh. Since, August 2017 ,the arrival of 1 Million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to Bangladesh the protected semi-evergreen natural forests of Cox's Bazar District faced an unprecedented deforestation in the history. Around 6000 hectares hilly landscape cleared for the settlement, roads, wash, health, education infrastructures. The wild flora and fauna of this region face threat to extinction. In order to mitigate the landslide risk, flash flood, it was an urgent to restore the degraded hills, and stable this land to protect top soil as well as the refugees. My major responsibilies are given below*
* Developing plantation site assessment methodology, data collection, data analysis, and assessment report submission to WFP and FAO
* Proposal writing for new phase, budget and work plan preparation
* Analysis of the remote sensing and ground survey data to identify landslide and flood prone zone identification to implement biomechanical and disaster risk reduction technologies.
* Communication and coordination with site management, site planning and site development agencies, meeting RRRC office, CiCs, and ACiCs, and BFD officials for implementing project interventions along with incorporated updates from Inter-sectoral coordination and technical coordination of RRRC, BFD, EETWG, FAO.
* Planning and designing raw geo data collection, database management, data cleaning, data analysis and visualizations.
* Document lessons learned and best practices in the form of success story, writing periodical plantation journals, donor reports and factsheets, monitoring and guiding junior colleagues in field supervision, Information Management (IM), Maintain liaison, Stakeholders’ consultation, Training the field data collectors, Report writing
